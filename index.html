			<h2 id="about" class="headings">About</h2>						
			<div>
				<p>
				I'm an adventurous, relentlessly focused, goal oriented and ambitious individal that is passionate about the <em>Technology industry</em> and striving towards being a skilled <me>Software Engineer</me>.
				One of my life goals is to use the acquired skills through Software Engineering to aid people and organisations.
				</p>	
			
				<p> 
				Being <em>Dyslexic</em> has proved to be a challenge initially but I have adepted to using it to my advantage in a sense of thinking outside the box/beyond the learning constraints, 
				therefore adeptable to various welcomed challenges because it's through learning to simplify complex concepts and challenges that my skills have been sharpened, and my problem solving skills refined.

				Having workied in the <em>Services industry</em> I have developed great interpersonal skills through various interactions with clients of different cultures, 
				thus I have a strong sense of team work ethic and conflict resolution skills.
				</p>
			
				<p>
				My taste for adventure keeps me going because just as much as traveling exposes me to new designs in nature, so does learning new technologies because it exposes you to different problems to solve,
				as well as meeting new people from across the world. And this sense of adventure has been apart of me since I was introduced to remote controlled vehicles as a young boy because I was curious to know <b>How It Works</b>, 
				hence Software Engineering is the ideal role for me because I get to not only know the inner machinics but also create those very inner machinics that lead me to this adventure.
